  "age": int,                 # Age (1-120)
  "gender": str,              # "male", "female", or "other"
  "location": str,            # Patient location
  "symptoms": List[str],      # List of symptoms
  "vital_signs": dict,        # Optional vital signs
  "medical_history": List[str] # Optional medical history
}
```

### FacilityData
```python
{
  "facility_id": str,         # Unique facility identifier
  "name": str,                # Facility name
  "location": str,            # Facility location
  "type": str,                # Facility type

```

### Vital Signs (Optional)
```python

  "blood_pressure_systolic": int,    # Systolic BP in mmHg
  "heart_rate": int,                 # Heart rate in bpm
  "oxygen_saturation": int           # O2 saturation in %
}
```

## Urgency Levels

The triage system classifies cases into four urgency levels:

- **Critical**: Requires immediate emergency intervention
- **High**: Needs urgent medical attention within hours
- **Medium**: Should be seen by a healthcare provider within a day
- **Low**: Can be managed with basic care and monitoring

Urgency is determined by:
1. Symptom matching with disease database
2. Age factors (children <5 and elderly >65 get escalated)
3. Vital signs assessment
4. Medical history considerations
